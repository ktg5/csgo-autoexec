# Ktg5's CSGO autoexec (cfg)
the autoexec i use for csgo

(thanks franz for cool sounds when press button)

You may edit this autoexec/cfg to fit your playstyle if you need to or don't like something about this.

## How to install
1. Download the autoexec file
2. Go to your CSGO installation and go to `/csgo/cfg` then copy and paste the autoexec into that `cfg` folder.
3. Launch CSGO and type `exec autoexec` in console.
4. play game.

## So what does this do/change?
- L-SHIFT is duck, and L-CTRL is walk. (you can change this by running `+swapctrl` and `+swapshift`)
- Cool sound effects when pressing keys like L-SHIFT and L-CTRL.
- Turns off very uncool things like switching to the gun you just picked up, and use = buy as well.
- Swap left and right hands by pressing T.
- Aliases to turn on stuff. (see below)

### Cool aliases
You can add these to the start of the autoexec at the end of the autoexec/cfg or use the aliases in console.

`+crosshair` - my crosshair I use. "Minecraft crosshair".

`+sens` - mouse sens I use.

`+swapctrl` - swaps L-CTRL to what would be default (+ sound).

`+swapshift` - swap L-SHIFT to what would be default (+ sound).

`+reset-hud` - resets HUD scaling to default.

`+reset-viewmodel` - resets viewmodel FOV to default and viewmodel offset to 0.

`+reset-other` resets all commands in the "other." section of the autoexec/cfg to default.

### Buy binds
See the `gun-binds.png` image for more details on that.
